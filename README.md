Alternatively installation can be done by `pip` directly from the GitHub repository:

### CHIME Database Configuration

To install the `ch_util` python package with configuration to connect to the CHIME database:

    $ pip install .[chimedb_config]

With this configuration, the connection to the CHIME database from the standard locations should
be automatic. Standard locations include:

* DRAO
* `cedar`
* `niagara`
* UBC PHAS network

By default, connections from everywhere else use a restricted account called `chunnel` on the
database server to tunnel the database connection to your local computer.  To use this tunnel, send
your SSH public key (the contents of `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to the `bao` sysadmins
and ask to have your public key added to the list of chunnel authorized keys.
